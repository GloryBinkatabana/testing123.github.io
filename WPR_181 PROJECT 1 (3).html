      <p>The <b>World Wide Web</b> (WWW) and the Internet are introductory technologies that have altered how we communicate, access information, and conduct business. The report aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the World Wide Web and the underlying technologies that have driven its evolution, as the report explores the history, architecture, and engineering aspects of the web, focusing on client-side and server-side development.</p>
      <h1 id="Overview"><u>Overview of the World Wide Web</u></h1>
      <div class="topdiv">
         
         <p>
            World Wide Web is refered to as WWW.The World Wide Web may be defined technically
            as all the users and resources on the Internet that make use of the HTTP protocol. The World
            Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which Tim Berners-Lee co-founded, provides a more
            comprehensive description. The World Wide Web is an embodiment of human knowledge 
            and the universe of network-accessible information. The World Wide Web may be defined as
            a method of information exchange between computers connected to the Internet, linking 
            them into a sizable database of interactive multimedia resources.

      <h1 id="History"><u>History of the Internet</u></h1>
      
      <p>
         Probably the first thing that comes to mind when I ask you is, "Who started the internet?" In
         the 1970s, Bob Kahn and Vint Cerf created the Internet. They started the process of creating
         what is now known as the "internet." It was the outcome of a different research project 
         known as ARPANET, or Advanced Research Projects Agency Network. The Defence Team of
         the United States of America originally intended for this to be a communications network 
         that could withstand a nuclear assault. It ultimately developed into a productive national 
         experimental packet network. However, when did the first Internet go live? It is thought that
         on August 6, 1991, the public launch of the World Wide Web.

      <h1 id="Evolution"><u>Evolution of the internet</u></h1>
      <p>
         Even though it was created much earlier, the Internet didn't become widely used in homes 
         until the 1990s. How many firms and households began modifying their working practises 
         and connecting their laptops and other gadgets to the Internet may be used to measure the 
         rise of the Internet. However, it was only at this period that the idea of hypertext transfer 
         protocol (HTTP) as we know it today was developed. This allowed users to exchange 
         information by accessing the same web sites on several devices.
      </p>
      <p>
         Since the internet's birth, its user base has dramatically increased. The number of 
         interconnected computer networks has also increased tremendously as a result. Initially, 
         there were just less than 10 computers connected. Direct connections between 440 million 
         computers now make life easier for individuals all around the world. For individuals who 
         have access to the Internet, sharing information and expertise has become incredibly simple. 
         China, with 1.4 billion users, is the nation with the most internet users, followed by India 
         with 1.3 billion and the United States with little over 0.3 billion.
      </p>
      <h1 id="Internetproto"><U>Internet  Protocol</U></h1>
      <p>
         Internet Protocols are a collection of guidelines that control how people communicate and 
         share data online. To transmit data, both the transmitter and the recipient must adhere to 
         the same protocols. Let's use a language as an example to help us better comprehend it. Any 
         language has its own vocabulary and grammar, which we must understand to communicate. 
         Like this, anytime we use the internet to browse a website or send data to another device, 
         such actions are subject to a set of guidelines known as internet protocols.
      </p>
      <p>
         Data is arranged into tiny units called packets, which are how the internet and many other 
         data networks operate. The underlying technology and software split up each large data 
         packet transferred between two network devices into smaller packets. According to the 
         protocols the network supports, each network protocol specifies the requirements for how 
         its data packets must be organised in particular ways.
      </p>

      <h1 id="webapp"><u>Web Application Architecture</u></h1>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
         A web app architecture shows the arrangement of all the software elements, including 
         middleware, databases, and apps, as well as how they work together.  It defines how the 
         data is sent through HTTP and makes sure that the client-side server and the backend server 
         can understand. Furthermore, it guarantees that all user requests contain correct data. It 
         provides authentication and permission-based access while managing and creating records.  
         The dependability, interoperability, and future IT requirements of your business are 
         determined by the design you choose. Therefore, it is crucial to comprehend the elements 
         that make up the architecture of web programmes.
      </p>
      <h2><u>Web Application Architecture Components</u></h2>
      <p><u>Web Browser</u></p>
      <p>
         The main element that engages with users, collects input, controls display logic, and 
         regulates user interactions with the programme is the browser, also known as the client-side 
         component or the front-end component. When necessary, user inputs are also checked.
      </p>
      <p><u>Web Server</u></p>
      <p>
         The web server, sometimes referred to as the backend component or the server-side 
         component, manages the whole application's operations while handling the business logic 
         and processing user requests by sending them to the appropriate component. It can manage 
         and managing requests from a range of clients.
      </p>
      <p><u>Database Server</u></p>
      <p>
         The data needed by the programme is provided by the database server. It manages tasks 
         involving data. Database servers may handle business logic with the use of stored 
         procedures in a multi-tiered design.
      </p>
      <h2><u>What is 3-tier architecture</u></h2>
      <p>
         The user interface on the client side and the backend system, which is often a database 
         server, make up a standard two-tier design. In this case, the database server or user 
         interface include the business logic. The drawback of 2-tier design is that performance 
         suffers as user density rises. Additionally, there are additional security issues raised by the 
         database's direct communication with the user device. Systems for managing content and 
         reservations for trains are two examples of applications that are frequently created utilising 
         this architecture.
      </p>
      <p>A three-tier architecture consists of the following layers:</p>
      <ol type="1">
         <li>Application layer/Business layer</li>
         <li>Presentation layer/client layer</li>
         <li>Data layer</li>
      </ol>
     
      <img src="Diagram-55-scaled (1).jpg" id="Diagram" class="img">
      <h1 id="Client"><u>Client side and Server side engineering </u></h1>
      <p>
         Client-side software operates on a user's web browser, whereas server-side programmes run 
         on a server. In contrast to server-side web development, which manages data behind the 
         scenes, client-side web development involves interaction and data presentation.
      </p>
      <p>
         Web development is an umbrella phrase for many different types of website construction, 
         not just one specific job. Client-side, server-side, and full-stack development are the three 
         main types of web development. For a website to work, client-side and server-side 
         programmes are required. To build a product that is well designed and works properly, 
         skilled developers who work in different sectors frequently need to collaborate closely.
      </p>
      <p>
         On the other hand, full-stack engineers possess both client- and server-side web 
         development expertise. Full-stack developers are frequently employed by businesses to 
         maintain and manage their online presence. We'll discuss server-side vs. client-side web 
         development in this post. We'll also go through how to pick up the programming languages 
         you'll need to get a job in the field.
      </p>
      <h2><u>Client-side</u></h2>
      <p>
         All elements a site visitor sees and interacts with are created by client-side developers. 
         Client-side developers employ their coding prowess to produce dynamic websites and online 
         apps that are aesthetically pleasing, useful, and practical. Every element of a website that 
         consumers view or interact with is created by these programmers. Virtually any visible 
         element that appears in a web browser or requires user interaction falls under this 
         discipline, including homepages, shopping sites, slideshows, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
         On the client's device, all this software is active. Since user interaction occurs on the "front" 
         of a web page, client-side developers are often referred to as "front end" programmers. 
         These developers are well paid for their job. Of course, pay may differ depending on the 
         business and the area. JavaScript, HTML, and CSS are three popular scripting languages that 
         front end developers use to write client-side code.
      </p>
      <h2><u>Server-side</u></h2>
      <p>Data communication between websites and servers is coded by server-side developers.</p>
      <p>
         We must first discuss how a website functions and how it differs from an image or an 
         interactive text piece to comprehend what a server-side developer performs. A website's 
         client-side functions as little more than a platform for information presentation and 
         gathering. To deliver the services, you want, the website interacts with web servers, utilising 
         them to retrieve and transfer data from databases.
      </p>
      <p>
         The server-side code that enables this data transmission is designed, created, and 
         maintained by these software engineers. Backend developers are another name for these 
         programmers. They operate in the background, ensuring that everything functions properly 
         on the application servers.  These developers are often fluent in server-side programming 
         languages including Python, SQL, Ruby on Rails, PHP, and Java.

      <h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
      <p>In conclusion, the World Wide Web, Internet, and web development have transformed the way we access and interact with information and services. The Internet's evolution from its origins in scientific research to a global network has paved the way for the Web's emergence as a dynamic platform for information retrieval and communication. The distinction between the Internet and the Web highlights their interconnected yet distinct roles, with protocols and technologies facilitating seamless communication. The evolution of Internet protocols and the architecture of web applications have further refined our online experiences, enabling both client-side and server-side interactions that shape the modern digital landscape. As we move forward, understanding these foundational concepts remains essential for harnessing the full potential of the digital realm.</p>
